## Baby's First Graphics Engine

a Rust port of [javidx9's excellent C++ graphics engine tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU&t=1659s). still has some kinks and I haven't added textures yet but can take an .obj file, render it, rotate it, and move a camera around it (or rather, move it around the camera....). this was my first Rust project!
